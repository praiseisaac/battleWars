# battleWars

This is a game I worked on for my final project for my Object Oriented Programming using Java class. If you are reading this, I have not taken the time to write a proper read me, so I apologize in advance for throwing you to the wolves. 

In summary, the main game can be found in the target/jlink-image/bin folder. The code files can be found in the main/java/edu/... folder. 

Requirements:
Javafx?? incase the image did not link the javafx modules and if you intend to run the code from an IDE/a text editor.
JVM, JDK, and JRE if you intend to work with code files.

In summary, the goal of the game is to not get killed but the enemies bullets, WASD controls, and left (any really) mouse buton to shoot. Goog luck, its an easy game. happy modding.
